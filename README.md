# Pneumonia Chest X-Ray Classification 

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to classifiy a large dataset of chest x-ray images using a convolutional neural network.

### Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

### Methods Used
* Deep Learning
* Data Visualization
* Image Augmentation

### Technologies
* Python
* TensorFlow
* NumPy
* Scikit-Learn
* Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project Description
In this project, I worked on a dataset from kaggle that contained thousands of images of pneumonia and normal chest x-rays. I created a neural network to to classify these images using convolutional layers and got an accuracy of 80.9% on my test set.
